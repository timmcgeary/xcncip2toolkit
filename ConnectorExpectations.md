# Introduction #

This page outlines the general expectations for a developer thinking about writing or modifying an ILS connection driver.

An outstanding overview (and story) of what is involved in building a new connector can be found at http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/5608.  It details the work that Lehigh University did to write a connector for Symphony.

  * Familiar with Java to write back end connector
  * Staff with understanding of ILS operations and work-flows in order to load test records, load test patron information
  * Server to test read/write operations of the toolkit (so as to not effect a production ILS)
  * Willingness to provide basic support for connector developed (ideally answering questions and providing quidance that may arise after release)
  * Willingness to participate in XC NCIP toolkit developer community
  * Ability to contribute code under MIT license is a MUST
