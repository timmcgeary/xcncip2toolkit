Code Contributions to the NCIP Toolkit have been made by the institutions below.

  * OCLC - contributed substantially to the core of the NCIP version 2.0 code base.  OCLC has contributed code that ensures compliance with the NCIP Schema (through JAXB) and core code for several NCIP Services

We are interested in making the NCIP Toolkit the best that it can be.  This includes continuing to expand the number of NCIP Initiators (e.g. discovery systems and borrowing systems) and the number of NCIP Responders (e.g. ILS).
